During the fall of 2012 Sweden has been engaged in an intense debate about racism in childrens film, literature and comics. Elsewhere on this site you'll find a [very comprehensive timeline](/thedebate) listing all articles, blogposts, press releases, interviews etc that have been published. Every entry on that timeline also contains a link to a Google translate version, which will give you a rough idea about what's being said. But machine translation still leaves a great deal to be desired.

This summary page aims to give the English language reader an overview of the main events in the debate, summarize the arguments being made and to provide some explanatory context where needed. The summary focuses on the arguments being put forth by those who feel that reusing racist stereotypes isn't really a big problem. There's been a lot of counter arguments made as well, but those arguments will most likely already be familiar to the English language reader. 

_Full disclosure_: My name is  Oivvio Polite and I'm very much a part of this debate.
 I've written several articles as well as gone on national radio to condemn the proliferation of racist stereotypes. I'm a writer, a programmer and a father of three.

Illustrator and director Stina Wirsén appears on the morning TV show "Gomorron Sverige". Together with actor Stellan Skarsgård she talks for about 15 minutes about their joint venture "Liten skär och alla små brokiga" a 30 minute cartoon for very young children.

Several clips featuring the pickaninny character are played, yet the host never broaches the subject of stereotypes. More than sloppy journalism I'd say that this omission is a reflection of the fact that Swedes, in general, aren't very familiar with the history of racism.

A word for word translation of the title would be "Little pink and all the small multi colored ones". In trying to find a more graceful translation I and others came up with "Little Pink and the Motley Crew". Later I realized that the production company behind the film use the English title "Little pink and brokiga" leaving the last Swedish word in place. Later yet I realized that "Brokiga" is also the name for the international brand of merchandise products based on the characters from the film and the books that came before the film.

The team behind _Liten skär_ issue a [press release](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=283084368458060&id=276727909093706) stating that they are well aware of the tradtion of racist imagiry but that they felt that 

> We've reached a point in history where it should be possible to stylize a dark figure in the same way as one 
> would a light. It's partly because of the blackface stereotype that it's very rare to see any
> really dark skinned kids in movies for children today ... It's unfortunate to avoid the depiction a black
> figure because of [the blackface tradition]. We wanted to puncture that tradition.

Literary critic Jonas Thente writes in leading Swedish daily [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/jonas-thente-jag-fick-nypa-mig-i-oronen-nar-horde-att-barnfiguren-var-rasistisk), where Stina Wirsén worked as illustrator and head of illustration during 1993 - 2010.

> I'll admit that I had to pinch myself after hearing that Stina Wirsén movie _Little pink and brokiga_
> has been attacked for being racist. 
> Yes, as usual we're dealing with a young humanities scholor who together with some bloggers 
> and twitterati gone beserk after concluding that one of the characters ... according to them
> looks like a "racist stereotype".
>
> ...
> I'm well aware of the struggle for scholarships and funding within Swedish academia. 
> One has to make headlines to get the dough, to make more headlines to get more dough and so on.
> 
> I'm know that make good research in the humanities is very time-consuming and you have
> wrap your head around all this really challenging literature, which you don't have
> the time to do since your busy fighting for funding, but there's always shorcuts through
> tabloid headlines, blogs, twitter och American domestic policy.

> But still: You have to be at _tiiiny_ bit more inventive than calling Stina Wirsén a racist.




### 11 September 2012

Stina Wirsen is interview by TT Spektra (a Swedish news agency whose articles are syndicated nationwide). Wirsen says that she and the distributors are retracting the movie poster for "Liten skär".

> Our intention was the direct opposite and we are really sorry if anyone 
> feels insulted or think that we are perpetuating racist imagery. 
> We don't want to quarrel and so we have decided to retract the post 
> that they have reacted to.

This is statement is met with some confusing on social media where black swedes discuss the matter. Nobody feels that the poster was the  problem, and that everything would be fine if we just got rid of the poster.


### 11 September 2012

Sverker Lenas, another former colleague of Wirsens, [writes in Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/sverker-lenas-synd-om-det-leder-till-mer-radsla) and makes the following argument:

1. Black kids are completely absent in Swedish childrens culture.

2. Stina Wirsen is countering this  status quo by drawing a black child. 

3. Being overly critical of Wirsens attempt at introducing greater diversity might deter other childrens books authors to do the same thing, thus perpetuating the dominance of white characters.
