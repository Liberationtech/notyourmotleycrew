During the fall of 2012 Sweden has been engaged in an intense debate about racism in childrens film, literature and comics. Elsewhere on this site you'll find a [very comprehensive timeline](/thedebate) listing all articles, blogposts, press releases, interviews etc that have been published. Every entry on that timeline also contains a link to a Google translate version, which will give you a rough idea about what's being said. But machine translation still leaves a great deal to be desired.

This summary page aims to give the English language reader an overview of the main events in the debate, summarize the arguments being made and to provide some explanatory context where needed.

_Full disclosure_: My name is  Oivvio Polite and I'm very much a part of this debate.
 I've written several articles as well as gone on national radio to condemn the proliferation of racist stereotypes. I'm a writer, a programmer and a father of three.

Illustrator and director Stina Wirsén appears on the morning TV show "Gomorron Sverige". Together with actor Stellan Skarsgård she talks for about 15 minutes about their joint venture "Liten skär och alla små brokiga" a 30 minute cartoon for very young children.

Several clips featuring the pickaninny character are played, yet the host never broaches the subject of stereotypes. More than sloppy journalism I'd say that this omission is a reflection of the fact that Swedes, in general, aren't very familiar with the history of racism.

The film "Liten skär och alla små brokiga" premiers. 




A word for word translation of the title would be "Little pink and all the small multi colored ones". In trying to find a more graceful translation I and others came up with "Little Pink and the Motley Crew". Later I realized that the production company use the English title "Little pink and brokiga" leaving the last Swedish word in place. Later yet we realized that "Brokiga" is also the name for the international brand of merchandise products based on the characters from the film and the books that came before the film.
