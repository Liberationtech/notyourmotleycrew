During the fall of 2012 Sweden has been engaged in an intense debate about racism in childrens film, literature and comics. Elsewhere on this site you'll find a [very comprehensive timeline](/thedebate) listing all articles, blogposts, press releases, interviews etc that have been published. Every entry on that timeline also contains a link to a Google translate version, which will give you a rough idea about what's being said. But machine translation still leaves a great deal to be desired.

This summary page aims to give the English language reader an overview of the main events in the debate, summarize the arguments being made and to provide some explanatory context where needed. The summary focuses on the arguments being put forth by those who feel that reusing racist stereotypes isn't really a big problem. There's been a lot of counter arguments made as well, but those arguments will most likely already be familiar to the English language reader. 

_Full disclosure_: My name is  Oivvio Polite and I'm very much a part of this debate.
 I've written several articles as well as gone on national radio to condemn the proliferation of racist stereotypes. I'm a writer, a programmer and a father of three.

### 4 September 2012

Illustrator and director Stina Wirsén appears on the morning TV show "Gomorron Sverige". Together with actor Stellan Skarsgård she talks for about 15 minutes about their joint venture "Liten skär och alla små brokiga" a 30 minute cartoon for very young children.

Several clips featuring the pickaninny character are played, yet the host never broaches the subject of stereotypes. More than sloppy journalism I'd say that this omission is a reflection of the fact that Swedes, in general, aren't very familiar with the history of racism.

A word for word translation of the title would be "Little pink and all the small multi colored ones". In trying to find a more graceful translation I and others came up with "Little Pink and the Motley Crew". Later I realized that the production company behind the film uses the English title "Little pink and brokiga" leaving the last Swedish word in place. Later yet I realized that "Brokiga" is also the name for the international brand of merchandise products based on the characters from the film and the books that came before the film.

A critical discussion begins on Folkets Bio Facebook page. Folkets Bio is small independent movie theater chain.

The team behind _Liten skär_ issue a [press release](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=283084368458060&id=276727909093706) stating that they are well aware of the tradition of racist imagery but that they felt that 

> We've reached a point in history where it should be possible to stylize a dark figure in the same way as one 
> would a light. It's partly because of the blackface stereotype that it's very rare to see any
> really dark skinned kids in movies for children today ... It's unfortunate to avoid the depiction of a black
> figure because of [the blackface tradition]. We wanted to puncture that tradition.

Literary critic Jonas Thente writes in leading Swedish daily [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/jonas-thente-jag-fick-nypa-mig-i-oronen-nar-horde-att-barnfiguren-var-rasistisk), where Stina Wirsén worked as illustrator and head of illustration during 1993 - 2010.

> I'll admit that I had to pinch myself after hearing that Stina Wirsén movie _Little pink and brokiga_
> has been attacked for being racist. 
> Yes, as usual we're dealing with a young humanities scholar who,  together with some bloggers 
> and twitterati, has gone beserk after concluding that one of the characters ... according to them
> looks like a "racist stereotype".
>
> ...
> I'm well aware of the struggle for scholarships and funding within Swedish academia. 
> One has to make headlines to get the dough, to make more headlines to get more dough and so on.
> 
> I know that to do good research in the humanities is very time-consuming and you have to 
> wrap your head around all this really challenging literature, which you don't have
> the time to do since you're busy fighting for funding, but there are always shorcuts through
> tabloid headlines, blogs, twitter and American domestic policy.

>
> But still: You have to be a _tiiiny_ bit more inventive than calling Stina Wirsén a racist.




### 11 September 2012

Stina Wirsén is interviewed by TT Spektra (a Swedish news agency whose articles are syndicated nationwide). Wirsén says that she and the distributors are retracting the movie poster for "Liten skär".

> Our intention was the direct opposite and we are really sorry if anyone 
> feels insulted or think that we are perpetuating racist imagery. 
> We don't want to quarrel and so we have decided to retract the post 
> that they have reacted to.

This statement is met with some confusion on social media where black Swedes discuss the matter. Nobody feels that the poster was the  problem, and that everything would be fine if we just got rid of the poster.


### 11 September 2012

Sverker Lenas, another former colleague of Wirséns, [writes in Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/sverker-lenas-synd-om-det-leder-till-mer-radsla) and makes the following argument:

1. Black kids are completely absent in Swedish childrens culture.

2. Stina Wirsén is countering this  status quo by drawing a black child. 

3. Being overly critical of Wirséns attempt at introducing greater diversity might deter other children's books authors to do the same thing, thus perpetuating the dominance of white characters.


### 13 September 2012


Ulf Stark, a prolific children's books author, who have collaborated with Wirsén on several projects, writes in [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/debatt-essa/med-lilla-hjartat-pa-ratta-stallet)

His argument is that Wirséns depiction of a black child might be close to an old stereotype but that it is not racist. Rather, he argues, it is the attempts to reduce the difference of black characters, making them more white, that are problematic. And he goes on to say:

> They [Wirsén and her collaborators] create a version of the racist 
> black girl-cliche. But they give it new content - humor, warmth, 
> curiosity and pranks - so striking that the old image crackles...

Erik Helmersson, editorial writer at Dagens Nyheter, repeats some of the arguments of his colleagues and [adds a couple of new ones](http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/filmdebatt-den-mest-krankta-har-inte-alltid-ratt), mainly that even though some black people are critical of "Lilla Hjärtat", that doesn't mean that they need to be listened too. He erroneously identifies ASR (The Afro Swedish National Association) as the main critics, although ASR actually had not spoken out about "Lilla hjärtat" at this point.

> ASR:s arguments are weak or that one should not listen to them.
> But one should be careful about equating their voice with the opinion
> of all Afro-Swedes.

### 25 September 2012

Dagens Nyheter publishes a story about Behrang Miri, the artistic director at TioTretton (TenThirteen), an activity space for tweens housed at Kulturhuset (a large cultural institution) in the center of Stockholm. Behrang Miri had decided to move the comic-book "Tintin in the Congo" from TioTretton to Serieteket. Serieteket is a special comics only-library within Kulturhuset. It's directed towards an adult and young adults audience.

This article is given a prominent placement and accompanied by an [opinion piece](http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/birgitta-rubin-utrensningen-vacker-dubbla-kanslor-hos-mig) criticizing the move.

The Miri-interview sparks outrage among the Swedish twitterati and by lunchtime Erik Sjöström, the director of Kulturhuset and Behrang Miri's superior, has gone on record retracting Miris decision of moving the collection from one part of Kulturhuset to another. 


<!--My theory, without a lot backing it up really. Dagens Nyheter, where getting a uncomfortable with the Wirsén-discussion.   -->

Aftonbladet, one of the two major evening papers in Sweden, publishes an [article](http://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/article15498578.ab) by Herman Lindqvist, one of Sweden's most renowned historians. He argues sarcastically against Behrang Miri's moving "Tintin in the Congo". He says:

>"...why not go to the root of all evil? Out with the Bible and the Koran - there is a lot of racism and homophobia there. Out with Shakespeare, Astrid Lindgren and The Southern Seas, be gone Robinson Crusoe."

>"Hurl out the bulk of world literature."

>"Yes, why not throw out all the volumes of world history too? So much colonial thinking permeates those books. Page up and page down!"

Björn Wiman, Dagens Nyheter's culture section's editor-in-chief writes a piece in Dagens Nyheter, [commenting on the reactions](http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kronikor/bjorn-wiman-vad-blir-det-kvar-av-konsten-om-allt-socker-tas-bort-ur-saften) against "Tintin in the Congo" and Stina Wirsén's movie. He calls the reactions "violent", and discerns two different ways of dealing with the "conflict of ideas": 
The first is to see the conflict as having "a value in itself, to believe that the friction in the free exchange of views slowly pushes humanity in the right direction."
The second way is "more problematic" according to Wiman, because that way means eliminating possible causes of infraction before going public with things. Wiman says that the "practical consequenses can become grotesque".
"The good will risks sweeping the real conflicts in society under the rug and hide the oppression that actually exists".

### 16 October 2012

In Dagens Nyheter, Sverker Lenas reiterates the argument that even though the blackface-character in Wirsén's movie is debatable, the dominance of blue-eyed blond children in children's books is a bigger problem. "After all, the movie's purpose was anti-racist", he writes. He expresses surprise that the debate got more into a frenzy over this than for example residential segregation and labour market discrimination. He points out that opinions about Wirsén's movie differs amongst "non-whites" (referring to the one article by Makode Linde and one by Sherlot Jonsson), and that the meaning of blackface is contextual and does not automatically have the same meaning as 80 years ago when it is made "in a multi-cultural society in our time, with another intent".
